A Georgia Tech-inspired badge created for the HAAG.

The design brings in Tech gold and navy, a hexagonal energy core, and a cybernetic hex shield reminiscent of campus architecture. Customize the SVG by adjusting gradients, typography, or identifier strings (for example, `ID-HAAG-1885`) to align with other HAAG credentials and Georgia Tech branding assets.
