The design brings in Tech gold and navy, a hexagonal energy core, and a cybernetic hex shield reminiscent of campus architecture. Customize the SVG by adjusting gradients, typography, or identifier strings (for example, `ID-HAAG-1885`) to align with other HAAG credentials and Georgia Tech branding assets.
## Highlights
- Georgia Tech gold-and-navy palette with layered gradients and soft glows.
- Interlocking GT built directly in SVG paths for crisp rendering on any display size.
- Hexagonal "energy core" patterned with circuits plus credential plate for `ID-HAAG-GT-2024`.

Feel free to tailor the identifier strings, gradients, or typography to match other HAAG credentials and Georgia Tech branding systems.
